# Overview
A sample code for Shopify app for scratch build. Read [this](https://shopify.dev/apps/auth/oauth/getting-started) first.


# Code structure
```
--------- App server as backend (Node.js) ---------
app.js ... Koa Node.js app for backend for app install endpoints, GraphQL API calls, and DB access, etc. No Shopify libraries or CLI generated code used.

package.json ... app.js used npm libaries and scripts for building and running this app.

views/ ... holds Koa Node.js dynamic rendering htmls. This is a SPA app which uses index.html only generated by Vite build in frontend.
  ./index.html ... Koa top page view rendered by app.js server code (for code running, this needs replaced with Vite built one).
public/ ... holds static files hosted by app.js server code (for code running, this needs replaced with Vite built one).

--------- App client as frontend (React) ---------
frontend/ ... React code base to be built by Vite for app admin UI. All built code runs at the client = browser as minized JS + CSS.

  ./src/ ... React source code with JSX of Shopify App Bridge + Polaris.
  ./index.html ... replaces views/index.html as a Vite built file which renders the root React compoment.  
  ./public/ ... Static files used by React code.
  
  ./package.json ... React code used npm libraries and scripts for building React code with Vite.
  ./vite.config.js ... Vite congfig file for building React code into real runnable minized JS + CSS on browsers.
```

# How to run
1. Add the following environmental variables locally or in cloud platforms like Render / Heroku / Fly, etc.
```
  SHOPIFY_API_KEY:              YOUR_API_KEY (Copy and paste from your app settings in the partner dashbord)
  SHOPIFY_API_SECRET:           YOUR_API_SECRET (Copy and paste from your app settings in the partner dashbord)
  SHOPIFY_API_VERSION:          2023-01
  SHOPIFY_API_SCOPES:           write_products,write_discounts,read_orders

  SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE:              MONGODB (Default) / POSTGRESQL

  // The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'MONGODB'
  SHOPIFY_MONGO_DB_NAME:        YOUR_DB_NAME (any name is OK)
  SHOPIFY_MONGO_URL:            mongodb://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN:YOUR_PORT/YOUR_DB_NAME

  // The followings are required if you set SHOPIFY_DB_TYPE 'POSTGRESQL'
  SHOPIFY_POSTGRESQL_URL:       postgres://YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASSWORD@YOUR_DOMAIN(:YOUR_PORT)/YOUR_DB_NAME
```

2. Build and run the app server locally or in cloud platforms. All settings are described in ./package.json.
```
Build command = npm install && npm run build (= cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && rm -rf ../public && mv dist ../public && mv ../public/index.html ../views/index.html  *Replacing Koa view files with Vite buit code)

Start command = npm run start (= node app.js)
```

3. If you run locally, you need to ngrok tunnel for public URL as follows (otherwise, the commands above are usable in Render or other platform settings).
```
cd NGROK_DIR && ngrok http 3000
```

4. Set `YOUR_APP_URL` (your ngrok or other platform URL) and `YOUR_APP_URL/callback` to your app settings.

5. (For PostgreSQL user only,) create the used table in your database (in `psql` command or other tools).
```
CREATE TABLE shops ( _id VARCHAR NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, data json NOT NULL, created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL );
```
